    <p class="p"> NATURAL SELECTION </p>
    <a class="a"> Natural selection is the process of gradual evolution where the organisms best suited to the environment tend survive and produce offspring. This is known as the process of natural selection that was advanced by Charles Darwin to explain how change occurs in species over time or across generations. </a>
    
    <img src="darwin.png" alt="dar" class="darwin">
    <p class="charles"> Charles Darwin was a British naturalist, born in Shrewsbury, England, in 1809 and passing away in Kent in 1882. He came from a family of intellectuals, being the grandson of Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood. Darwin studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and biology at Cambridge. He was chosen as a naturalist for the HMS Beagle expedition from 1831 to 1836, which took him to South America and the South Seas. His observations of animals and rocks during this voyage led to many important discoveries and laid the groundwork for his theories of evolution.</p>

    <div class="sec"> </div>
    <p class="selec"> I think we all recall that evolution is the process of alteration of the traits of a population over a given period of time. More precisely, it refers to alterations in the gene frequencies in a population or line. Alleles are two or more, different forms of genes that are passed to any organism through sexual and asexual means. For instance, eye color in humans has several alleles meaning that different people have different eye colors, for example, brown, red, black or blue. The combination of alleles is known as genotype, whereas the totality of actual physical features characteristic of the genotype is known as phenotype. It is in this chapter that several factors that change alleles in a population, and how this change may, in the long run, bring about new species, will be discussed.
    </p>
    <p class="selec1"> It is important to recall that natural selection is the main responsible factor behind evolutionary change in population. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace made the following observation that organisms within a population forever fight for the few resources available so only some of them reproduce. Genetically endowed individuals will be more likely to live longer and have offspring, meaning their genes will be carried on to the next generation. Because these attributes are genetic, they tend to reoccur in the next generations of female offspring. Organisms with advantageous phenotypic characteristics are regarded as having higher fitness, that is a higher probability of surviving and reproducing.
     </p>

    <div class="gala"> 
        <p class="bird"> Almost always, real-life examples of natural selection can take a long while to happen. A particularly clear example is the case of the Galápagos finch birds; in fact, these birds contributed to the development of this theory. The grants first began their work on these finches in 1976, and this research became instrumental in the determination of natural selection. They tracked alterations in the size and form of beaks of medium ground finches in Daphne Major, an island in the Galápagos. These finches feed on seeds while some are depicted as having bulky, deep beaks while others possess thin beaks. Large billed birds are therefore able to exploit large, hard seeds most effectively while those birds which have small bills are more suited to obtaining small, soft seeds.
             </p>
        <p class="nine">In 1977, drought limited the availability of seeds at all developmental stages, especially the smaller and less hardened seeds. As a result, those birds that had larger beaks had a higher chance of survival as they could reach food that small-beaked birds could not. The following year, the Grants discovered that on average the size of the beak of the Galapagos finch had changed, thus proving that natural selection had indeed played out in the bird’s favor in relation to the availability of seed. They understood this by using their prior knowledge of how a smaller population of beak size relates to the inheritance of large beaks about the changes in the beak size in the offspring of the larger population of survivors. Further on, the later studies of the scientists indicated that the beak sizes changed successfully over time and were larger when it was advantageous and smaller on the contrary, if the seeds were scarce.

    <div class="variation">
        <p class="v"> VARIATION AND ADAPTATION</p>
        <p class="var"> Variation refers to the differences in physical traits and behaviors among individuals within a species, which can be caused by genetic differences or environmental factors. Adaptation is the process by which organisms develop traits that enhance their ability to survive and reproduce in specific environments, often as a result of natural selection acting on variations.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="adapt"> 
        <p class="one first"> Natural selection can exist only if there is variation among individuals in a population and the variation is heritable; selection will then bring about change in the traits in the successive generations. Variation can also be non-genetic, for example, a person with better nutrition being taller. However, this does not really have any relevance in the evolutionary process.
        </p>
        <p class="one second">In general terms, an adaptation can be defined as an innate characteristic possessed by an organism that ensures its functionality and capability of reproducing in a given ecosystem. Fitness subjected to changes results from Genotypes that make changes or remain constant in order to meet the needs of the population as it is found in its environment. For instance, there were changes in the beak of finches in relation to the food resources available to them.
        </p>
        <p class="one third">An adaptation is different from an acclimation which only is a temporary change of the phenotype of an organism because of some changing conditions of the environment. For example, a dog in a hot environment will have more of a smooth skin but more skin pigment in a cold environment. This adaptation is known to be short-term and does not form a favorable gene pool for the next generations.
        </p>
        <p class="one fourth"> A reaction will therefore be more favorable depending on the environment in which it exists. A trait beneficial in one set of conditions may be disadvantageous in another, as seen with finches: big beaks available in one area while small beaks were suitable in another area in the same environment hence, stabilizing prices was difficult.

    <div class="mut">
        <p class="mutation">MUTATION</p>
        <p class="dna"> A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of an organism, which can occur naturally or due to environmental factors. These alterations can lead to variations in the genetic code, potentially causing changes in an organism's traits or functions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="div"> 
        <p class="text"> Mutation is a source of variation, new alleles in the populations, and therefore it results in an increase in variation among individuals in the population. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of the gene and are inherited in it. A person with a mutated gene might be different from other members of the population in the sense that they have a different gene from the other members of the population. However, this is not always the case, so it is essential to brush up a bit on the basics to build on these foundational concepts. A mutation can have one of three outcomes on the organisms’ appearance (or phenotype): A mutation can have one of three outcomes on the organisms’ appearance (or phenotype):
            <br> <br>
            <span>A negative mutation on the other hand changes the phenotype of the animal in such a way that it has less<br> fitness—low probability of survival and therefore produces lesser offspring.</span>
            <br> <br>
            <span> A positive mutation results in a new survival advantage that changes the phenotype of the organism.</span>
            <br> <br>
            Mutations are also categorized according to their impact on the fitness of an organism, and for many cases, the mutations will not impact the fitness in any way.
            </p>
        <p class="text2">Mutation thus only alters the rate of evolution slightly because it only adjusts the quantity of frequency of the alleles in the population slightly. A mutation may occur and lead to an allele that is of a disadvantage to an individual or beneficial or in between. It is mentioned that group A changes get eliminated from the population by selection and in general they will exist within a population only in a very low frequency equal to the mutation rate. In selection, beneficial mutations beneficial to the species will spread in the population though the rate of spread at the beginning is slow. This way, one knows whether or not a given mutation actually aids an organism in surviving to sexual maturity and thereby having the capability to reproduce. As mentioned above, mutation serves as the primary mechanism of genetic variation in all population substructures—new alleles and consequently, new genetic variations are produced through this process. Resistance to antibiotics due to mutations in bacteria is another issue that cropped up in the field of medicine. One of the general properties of bacteria is their ability to replicate quickly, meaning that mutations may increase at a fast pace. This can enable the bacteria to adapt to the antibiotic drugs and even develop some resistance.
        </p>
        <p class="text3"> Thus, genetic drift can also be influenced by some negative impact and can be escalated in case of natural and man-made disasters, for instance, natural or artificial failure when only a few population members are killed; according to the bottleneck effect, this point is commented with a big portion of the genome might be obliterated at once. This happens in one go, while the survivors’ genes become the genes that the entire population, that is, millions and tens of millions of people: are very different from the pre-disaster gene pool. The disaster has to be one that kills and it cannot do so because of the organism’s characteristics; it can be a hurricane, lava flow, etc. Thus, mass killing resulting from low temperatures at night is likely to have different outcomes regarding the number of alleles particular individuals have that enable them to survive cold temperatures.

        <p class="geneticdrift"> GENETIC DRIFT </p>
        <p class="content"> Genetic drift is a mechanism of evolution that causes random changes in the frequency of alleles in a population, particularly in small populations. This process can lead to significant genetic variation over time, independent of natural selection.
        </p>

    <div class="para"> 
        <div class="para1"> 
        <p class="alle">
            Genetic drift is a random change in allele frequencies within a population. It reduces genetic variation, and its impact is more significant in small populations. If a population were infinitely large, genetic drift would not occur, but all real populations are finite. Genetic drift happens because the offspring generation is a random sample of the parent population's alleles. Factors like individual deaths, partner choice, and gamete fertilization contribute to this randomness.
            <br> <br>
            In small populations, the loss of even a single individual can significantly impact allele frequencies. For example, in a population of ten animals, losing one animal means losing 10% of the gene pool, whereas in a population of 100 animals, losing one is just a 1% loss. Random events like natural disasters can cause these shifts, impacting allele frequencies differently depending on the traits of the survivors.
            <br> <br>
            For instance, if a population starts with an equal number of two alleles, the next generation's allele distribution will vary randomly. Over time, one allele might become fixed (present in all individuals), and the other lost. This stochastic process is more evident in small populations and when allele frequencies are not balanced.
            <br> <br>
            Genetic drift can be intensified by events like population bottlenecks, where a large portion of the population is randomly killed, leaving a genetically different group of survivors. Another example is the founder effect, where a small group migrates and establishes a new population with different allele frequencies than the original population. This effect is seen in the Afrikaner population of South Africa, where certain genetic disorders are more prevalent due to the higher frequency of mutations in the founding colonists.

<div class="genflow"> 
    <p class="geneflow"> GENE FLOW </p>
    <p class="parag"> Gene flow is the movement of genes between populations, typically through the migration of individuals. It can introduce new genetic variation into a population and promote genetic diversity within species.
    </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="last1">
<p class="lastt"> Another mechanism is gene flow –the movement of alleles into and out of a population through the migration of individuals. It is worth noticing that some populations are relatively more or less fixed compared to the other populations. For instance, many plants generate their seeds and release them to distant places through air or in the intestines of animals; the seeds may bring alleles prevalent in the original population to a new population where they are hardly encountered. Like mutation, gene flow also increases the amount of variation that is present in a population because new alleles are introduced when some individuals move into this population.
